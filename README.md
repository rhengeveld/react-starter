# React-Starter

This is my React starter project. Started from scratch, to learn the structure and all components involved.  
Based on the ["How to start a React project from scratch"] (http://andrewhfarmer.com/react-from-scratch/)


## Commands

```
// initialize Git repo
git init

// create package.json
npm init -y

// don't forget to add node_modules to .gitignore

// install dependencies via npm
npm install
```
